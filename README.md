👋 Hi, I’m Christian

I’m a Computer Science student at California State University, Bakersfield, focused on software engineering, systems programming, and applied machine learning.

I’ve also worked as an ML/AI Research Intern at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center, contributing to computer vision and speech processing systems supporting autonomous flight research.

I enjoy building projects that deepen my understanding of how software works under the hood — from low-level systems and graphics programming to data-driven and ML-enabled applications.
